    The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If any of ``variables``
    are non-scalar (i.e. their data has more than one element) and require
    gradient, the function additionally requires specifying ``grad_variables``.
    It should be a sequence of matching length, that contains gradient of
    the differentiated function w.r.t. corresponding variables (``None`` is an
    acceptable value for all variables that don't need gradient tensors).

    This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to zero
    them before calling it.

    Arguments:
        variables (sequence of Variable): Variables of which the derivative will be
            computed.
        grad_variables (sequence of (Tensor, Variable or None)): Gradients w.r.t.
            each element of corresponding variables.  Any tensors will be
            automatically converted to Variables that are volatile unless
            ``create_graph`` is ``True``.  None values can be specified for scalar
            Variables or ones that don't require grad. If a None value would
            be acceptable for all grad_variables, then this argument is optional.
        retain_graph (bool, optional): If ``False``, the graph used to compute the grad
            will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting this option to ``True``
            is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient

    w.r.t the specified inputs. If it's ``False``, then gradient w.r.t. all remaining
